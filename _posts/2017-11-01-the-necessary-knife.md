My sister dearest  
Piece of my heart  
came bearing a wound  
that stung and did smart  

The wound was deep  
She bled tears and raw feeling  
without proper care  
there would be no healing  

I brought out the ointment  
of soothing words and caress  
Yet the tears never staunched  
Making me more, more nervous  

I put her on a dose  
Of her favourite chocolate  
Yet appetite and sane thought  
had gone down the toilet  

I gave her harsh treatment  
a shot of serious talk  
It worked; her vitals normalized  
before again running amok  

Desperate, I saw no option  
Other than the knife of reality  
I plunged its icy blade into her chest  
Trying to wake her from this insanity  

She bled out, collapsed and died  
I stood in numb terror  
My sister dearest, on the floor  
Splayed out like a homeless beggar  

She awoke, eyes shining fierce  
Her sickness was gone, she was birthed anew  
Yet on her face was a fiercer glimmer  
Perhaps, not the sister dearest I knew.
