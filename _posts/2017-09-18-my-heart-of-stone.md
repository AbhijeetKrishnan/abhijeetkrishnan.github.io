My heart of stone  
Once cause for mock  
Was cold as ice  
Was hard as rock  

I felt no shame  
In being oblivious to love  
And desire, longing, heartbreak, heartache  
Were emotions I was far above  

My statuesque life of rigid brow  
Was perturbed, cracked, then shattered  
The culprit was a girl I met  
At whose beauty even angels scattered  

Her looks, her walk, her grace, her charm  
Captivated my beginner heart  
But her smile, her care, her spirit, her love  
Was when Cupid struck his dart  

A whirlwind romance followed that morn  
Still young as whirlwinds go  
Alas, the whirlwind stopped too soon  
Cut down by Time's flow  

The jigsaw puzzle of our love  
Had almost been near complete  
Fate, that treacherous meddler  
Flung the pieces miles, not even feet  

And while my heart had transmuted  
By the Alchemy of her care  
From stone to tender flesh  
The pain was too much to bear  

And so I struggle on each day  
Quelling these fears and aches  
In the hope that I will meet her  
Across the oceans, seas and lakes  

And that meeting will be glorious  
For sweet is the fruit of patience  
I shall battle through each day of separation  
Another of my trials and tribulations  

Until I see you again
