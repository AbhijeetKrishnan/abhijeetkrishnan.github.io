I set the milk to the boil and  
Settled down with literature  
A biscuit plate beside me,  
I was quite comfortable  

A rushing sound pierced my ears  
A sound all too familiar  
The milk had boiled too long, you see  
And spilt all over the counter  

My biscuit fell into my milk  
Soggy and inconsistent  
It dipped in the liquid too long  
It dove in quite insistent  

I opened a book and started to read  
Alas! The page had folded  
A corner imperfect, a crease so deep  
Yet shallower than my disappointment  

I settled down to write a note  
To my dear beloved  
The ink gave out midway through love  
That unsupportive bastard  

I picked up instead a pencil  
Unfailing by design  
Yet the nib broke, as my heart spoke  
Oh this is all just fine  

I picked up a phone instead  
To reach his heart directly  
Yet grating static and modem beeps  
Made my message very erratic  

Content with a simple message online  
I sent him a sweet text  
He replied with an 'I do too'  
I sighed aloud, 'What next?'
