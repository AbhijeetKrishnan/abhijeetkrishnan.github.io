It starts with a whisper  
A sign of things to come  
The sound is soft still  
It's barely more than a hum  

The words start flying faster  
The tongue starts warming up  
The body begins to work as well  
No sign of fizzling out  

Oh, it's in the groove now  
Brave quotes earn scattered applause  
The audience leans forward into  
The worthy and passionate cause  

The voice reaches a climax  
Shocking revelation pitched on high  
Silence blankets the stunned receivers  
Too stunned to even cry  

An evenness in tone now  
As the call to action is spelled  
A poignant quote bookends the talk  
Ending the magic spell  

The sound of clapping rivals thunder  
In that enclosed theater of ideas  
The praise dies down, the audience sits down  
And wipes away their tears
