I alighted from the train; people  
packed tighter than luggage on  
the return trip. The rumble of the locomotive  
could not mask the rumble in  
my tummy, and I sought out the nearest  
vada pav wala, shouldering a city's hunger  
since who knows when  

I walked up to dull, oily shirt and raised  
one finger in a mute signal given meaning  
by my predecessors, who perhaps also  
did not heed their mother and skipped  
her warm breakfast that day  

he understood me as a lover understands  
her lover; silent gestures and silent words,  
an elegy in blank verse on blank paper  
he flipped over a golden vada  
from steaming hot oil. from the frying pan into the  
fiery red chutney, laid fast and thick  
in well-trodden motions on soft pav, clouds  
of sinful carbs, barbs in my diet  

with the skill of a craftsman and the  
confidence of a marksman, he  
wrapped my prize in today's paper  
rapes and murders and scams darkened  
not by human depravity but vegetable oil  
used many many times  

outstretched hand offered me the hot  
temptation, yet I in that instant, I looked  
into his eyes, and saw dirty little huts  
with blue roof and black moat  
buttressed by the sweat of children  

the contact snapped and I accepted his offering  
munching on my vada pav, I was content
