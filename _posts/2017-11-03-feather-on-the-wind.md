Buffeted by the winds  
darting this way and that,  
unpredictable, prone to  
lover's tendencies and nations  
squabbles; to  
life's joys and riches and also its  
harsh lessons; to  
grim forests, every leaf and sharp bark  
a wooden trap for the flyer  
a sudden upward gust  
clear air, clear world, blue peace  
the expanse frees the mind to expand  
for freedom is not restrictive, not a responsibility  
but it is life
