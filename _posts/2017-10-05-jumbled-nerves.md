I tried typing today  
No more the two-fingered peck  
I presume it will speed me up  
And keep RSI in check  

Yet when I follow my machine master  
I lose control of my digits  
My left hand steals the missives of my right  
I hurtle towards absurdness faster  

My fingers cannot find the keys  
Perhaps if they had eyes  
On every fingertip, I am sure  
My accuracy would rise  

I struggle on, against my  
Inefficient biology, yet when  
After an hour and half's practice, I find  
Touch typing not beyond my ken  

How marvellous this construct  
Of flesh and jumpy electricity  
Truly, we are creatures of clay  
Limited only by our ingenuity
