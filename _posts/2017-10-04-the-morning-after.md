I wake up with my eyes closed  
Yet the baser sensations engulf me  
Starting with the soft, velvety warmth  
Of my face, buried in the flesh of her bosom  

I inhale her scent  
From that perfect triangle of air  
Into which my head fits perfectly  
Like a jigsaw puzzle God created  

The scent of vanilla  
And fresh garden flowers  
And the saltiness of last night's activities  
Lingers in my nostrils  

I sense sensations stemming not from my sense organs  
Her heat comforts me, shielding me  
From man's intervention against the sun  
The softness of her form  
Tempts me, and I tighten my fingers involuntarily  
To see how deep into her I can plunge them  

The basest sensation of them all  
The feeling of having the one I love  
Sleep beside me, having braved the journey of a thousand miles  
And her own physical limitations  
All to see me, and be with me  
The feeling of having her in my arms  
A sensation of fullness, and completeness  
That come what may, she is there at my side  

I open my eyes  
And see her face
