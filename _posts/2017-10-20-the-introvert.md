Forged in the fires of solitude  
Bathed in the spotlight of shadow  
Silently screaming, it enters the world  
Seeking the attention of the massive few  

Supernatural bubble around it  
Keeps all intruders at bay  
Yet those wh    o receive the invitation  
Are given not just privilege but responsibility  

You suck out its vitality, with your  
Posturing and mindless conversation  
Leave it alone, let it heal, so that,  
Your social conventions might be fed  

Mistake not white words for  
Black humour, the creature chooses  
to express itself not with obligatory  
scratches but with deep, passionate cuts  
Right into your soul
