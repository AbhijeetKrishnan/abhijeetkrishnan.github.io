They came in the night  
A uniform storm  
Wielding voices of harsh violence  
And instruments of death  

We stood by silently  
As our house was violated  
They extracted their pound of flesh  
In the form of a box of white powder  

With that, the khaki whirlwind passed  
But claimed my husband as its victim  
How especially sad, after he had  
Recently lost his job  

I sat first on the sofa in the hall  
A demure peach bride of soft countenance  
Her clothes had been thrown helter-skelter  
I calmed her down and fixed her up  

I traveled to our bedroom  
That chamber of facing backs  
And patiently folded the strewn clothes  
And patiently put the clothes back into the open drawers  
And patiently closed the open drawers  
And patiently came the tears  

I headed to the store room  
And among the mess, I found  
My old collection of music CDs, how ironic  
That which he so easily had neglected  
Had been the hiding place of his shame  

The brown men, in their brusque haste  
Had cracked apart one of the discs, I picked it up  
It was a collection of Rafi songs, gifted to me  
By my late father, a loving reminder that he  
Would support me in whatever I did  

I glided back into my room  
Switched off the lights  
And went to bed
