Still born, thrust into 
prickly bed, pierced not  
by cotton pillow, or soft sheets,  
but by the arrows of  barbed thoughts  
cutting into the flesh of my self-worth  
drawing blood  
and turning my eyes red  
stung by the insects of shame  
and pity  

Desperate, I heap sand on the fire  
of broken dreams, and broken promises  
hoping to extinguish the inferno  
for tears are not enough  
A brief interlude  
my mind clears, the smoke disappears  
but an ember remains  
and so the blaze resumes  

Pain cannot help, for pain is dull  
worn blunt by the numbness within  
my fist tries to knock sense into my head  
so does the head of my bed  
and members of the tool shed  
I stop when I see red  

Bleary, weary and looking scary  
I wash my face but my eyes wash themselves  
*"I look normal,"* I think to myself, no trace of  
lost hope, of  
lost friends, of  
wasted life, of  
wasted breath
