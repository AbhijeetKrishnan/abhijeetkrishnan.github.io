title: Excellence is a Long Road

I learned a new skill today  
and showed it off to all my friends  
Best among them, I was,  
The wolf among the dogs  

They fed my ego; my excellence  
was the prime of their existence  
I wolfed down their compliments  
On their prairie praise I would graze  

An alpha showed me my place  
in the invisible chain of nature  
The blow was hit doubly hard  
The alpha was not lone but a herd  

A pack who sit above me  
Not just above, but out of reach  
Forever is not enough to even  
the difference between earth and sky  

My ego shattered, my pride undone  
I turned away my burning face  
The alpha extended a paw and  
Showed me how it's done
