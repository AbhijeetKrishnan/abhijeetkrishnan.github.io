I have a bookshelf  
Stacked to the ceiling  
With books of every kind  
And books from every place  
Books take me places  

To lands I've only seen  
In ink, black and white  
To lands I've never seen  
Nor will anyone else  
For they exist  
In the eye of my mind  

Yet the books overflow  
Spilling out from shelves  
This inefficient brain of mine  
Can only so few comprehend  

My fragile human body  
Has a finite time of existence  
Before bowing out with head held high  
Or low, given all the books unread  

I have not time for you all  
I have not the energy for you all  
Yet I want you all  
Every paragraph, page and thought  

Therefore, I shall kill you  
And take you to my afterlife  
For what better heaven can be imagined  
Than eternity in a library?
