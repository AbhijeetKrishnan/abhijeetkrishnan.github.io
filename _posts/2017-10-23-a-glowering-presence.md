I peer around the  
treacherous corners  
for the first shadow  
of trouble;
a sudden darkening;  
my heart quickens;  
It was another.  

Every nerve, every  
plastic synapse, moulded  
by fear, that claymaker,  
into a well oiled gear  
tuned to the danger  
I deal with everyday  

The predator's eyes, forward,  
to better hunt my predator;  
to flee, for there is no fight  
against the links of society.  

the voice from afar! my chest thrums  
to the beat of anxiety; the voice  
raises its voice, and I fear  
what is to follow
