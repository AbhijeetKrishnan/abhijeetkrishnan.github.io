we sit facing each other; two  
kidney beans facing each other, the gap  
between them like the gap in our conversation  
unnatural and unpleasant.  

the wooden table between us cannot  
rouse our conversation, though its circles  
have so much history to share. we choose  
to stay silent like leaves in still air.  

our waiter brings two mugs, filled to the brim  
with steaming hot coffee. we look at the brown  
liquid - her's pale, mine dark, and admire the  
artful designs the brewer constructed on the foam  
perhaps, in an attempt, to construct our dialogue.  

it doesn't work. we raise the potent brew to our  
lips - her's smooth pink, mine chapped grey, and  
drink. coffee beans from guyana or madagascar or  
nigeria or some other tropic died, oh yes they died  
to give you this heavenly brew, the smell  
oh that smell of freshly cut wood and sweet sugar and  
fresh paper with bleach white finish, eager to serve  
as the container for your ruminations on how  
good this coffee is.  

the foam bubbles above the drink, bubbling up my  
mood, each pop a conversation, each sip  
motivation, the chocolate notes a concert in my mind  
with vanilla the conductor, urging me to play my solo  
I oblige,  

*"The coffee's rather good, don't you think?"*
