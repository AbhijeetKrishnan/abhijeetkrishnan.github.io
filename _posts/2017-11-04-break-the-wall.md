break the wall  
hear me well  
heed the call  

no distance too small  
pain is pleasant hell  
break the wall  

if you struggle, stand tall  
Mastery's tree requires sharp axe to fell  
heed the call  

let mind and body brawl  
victor decided by the bell  
break the wall  

feel the world slow to a crawl  
soak in victory's sight and smell  
heed the call  

no goal out of reach, none at all  
all pearls are encased in hard shell  
break the wall  
heed the call
