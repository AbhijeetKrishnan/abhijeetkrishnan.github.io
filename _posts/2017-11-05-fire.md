fire  
rising up  
from broken timber  
the embers  
glowing red hot  
raging parents  
waiting to give birth  
to destruction  

the orange haze  
casting it's venomous light  
on everyone watching  
hypnotizing  
with its erratic  
jerkiness  
we see ourselves in the flame  
yet the flame sees nothing in us  
just fuel  
waiting to be consumed
