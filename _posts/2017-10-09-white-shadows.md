blank faces all around me  
blank faces around my bed  
blank faces with blank shadows  
am i already dead?  

white blankets keep me warm  
white light helps me see  
white cloth covering white memories  
who am i supposed to be?  

clear water in the glass besides  
clear tears stream down his face  
clear wind blowing through clear window  
he cries over my lace  

black is the night that follows  
black garments they wear to weep  
black suit closes lid on black coffin  
i close my eyes to sleep
