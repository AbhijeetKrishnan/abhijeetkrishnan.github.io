A painting at an angle,  
A book not on its shelf  
My earphones in a tangle,  
I'll clean them up myself.  

My bed's wrinkled and messy,  
The pillows all askew  
I hope I'm not too fussy  
If I make your bed too.  

The windows! Oh, the windows are  
dusty and full of grime  
To wash them less than thrice would be  
a terrible, terrible crime  

The pots and pans are in the sink  
The plants, freshly watered  
The letter's written in nice blue ink  
The chicks have all been slaughtered  

The bills have all been paid and the  
notices been read  
I hope that this will silence  
the itch inside my head.
