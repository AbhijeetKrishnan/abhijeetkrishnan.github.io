Swelling with effort  
the skin stretching taut  
almost bursting, but not quite  
Look! it expands without loss  
Making way for more  

How wondrous this body  
made of clay and behaves like it  
mold it to all suppressed desires  
watch it grow like earthen plants  
give form to the intangible mind  

Imagine if you will  
a body quite rigid, Newtonian  
in its lack of flexibility, in adaptability  
to stress, and to improvement  
What if the 1000th try was just as mediocre  
as the first?
