Behold, all ye people!  
I have accomplished today  
I have ticked off all my lists  
Nothing more left to say  

No more files to file  
No more reports to report  
I leave office a content employee  
My boss says nothing to which I retort  

I reached home, a perfect man  
I asked my family about their day  
I played with the kids a bit  
Even found the time to pray  

I listened to my wife vent  
About the neighbourhood spies  
She was happy when she found  
I had brought her favourite french fries  

I turned in for the night, satisfied  
My wife made me more so  
A hard day deserves a soft bed  
I slipped into dream's flow
