So long the route from trading floor  
to warm and marmalade home.  
I book a cab and off I go  
into the great unknown.  

Well-traveled in this place I am  
I instruct my driver's steer  
While browsing mails and catching up  
The road ahead seems clear.  

We run into some potholes  
Along the concrete grey  
Admonish here, encourage there  
We're soon back on our way.  

I look up from my hand-held black hole  
Unfamiliar with the terrain  
The driver took a wrong turn, it seems,  
I cast out a refrain.  

I know not where to go, I say,  
He tells me nor does he,  
In the amber light of night, we find  
Our courage start to flee  

I tell him it's his fault, I say  
he should not have made that turn  
He counters with you knew the road  
yet left me alone to burn  

We find our heated argument takes  
us nowhere close to home  
We swallow pride and fear and ask  
for help in midnight gloam  

A good Samaritan points out for us  
the turns we ought to take  
We jump back in and off we go  
Riding the tar-covered snake  

Though few more misses, a little more heat  
mars our perfect drive  
We find more people, more directions and help  
The driver and I now jive  

We reach our destination, thankfully  
all in one piece. This frond  
of adventure fused my friend and I  
into a solid bond
