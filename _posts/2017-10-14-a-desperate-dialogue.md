Green bowl, open your clam shell  
I am in desperate hour  

Go ahead, do it yourself, unfortunately  
I have no power  

Much thanks. Oh! But what is this?  
Stains of yellow dot your seat  

Blame that loose lover of yours  
Such inaccuracy is no mean feat  

I told him oft to put the seat down!  
I told him good and angry  

Well, not good enough, evidently  
The smell has made me cranky  

Well here you go! A wash should do  
To leave you fresh and clean  

Oh wonderful, but what's the point  
No wonder I am mean  

Well here goes, at long last  
Oh! Blessed relief!  

Ugh, it seems you gorged yourself  
On ill-prepared roast beef  

Well thank you dear, for that therapy  
I needed it in desperation  

It's not like I have a say in the matter  
Now flush, silly! I'm choking!
