Snap the thread of consumer fate  
Send back the order of flatscreen dish  
Don't just consume. Create.  

Why is the parcelled world filled with hate?  
For dimwitted souls, the network sharks fish  
Snap the thread of consumer fate  

Old things start to grate  
Every human has blank slate to tarnish  
Don't just consume. Create.  

Information overload - can't think straight  
Criticality in my fellow man - a naive wish  
Snap the thread of consumer fate  

Embrace deep passion, find a mate  
Write a book, cook horseradish  
Don't just consume. Create.  

The second Sin leads to obese state  
The reigns of intelligence, shall relinquish  
Snap the thread of consumer fate  
Don't just consume. Create.
