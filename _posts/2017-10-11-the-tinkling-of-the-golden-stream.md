title: The Tinkling of the Golden Stream 
tags: creative-writing poetry humour

the golden stream is thin  
sometimes it sprays wide  
sometimes it misses the mark  
it sometimes hits the side  

when it misses is when, oh  
the missus gets real mad  
put the seat down! she says  
you make me really sad  

the golden stream flows hard  
sometimes it flows in droplets  
the golden stream is molten gold  
but never the colour of chocolates  

the golden stream loses colour sometimes  
the sign of pink of health  
but when the gold sees red, you can  
be sure of losing your wealth  

the golden stream's a wonderful thing  
folks spray without a care  
oh, but when it flows, unstoppered, undammed  
the relief's beyond compare
