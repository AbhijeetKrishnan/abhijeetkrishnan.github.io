I am a grey flat, not slope nor steep incline  
nor rolling cylinder nor irregular figure  
I stay stable, come what may  
be it red from the left, or  
blue from above  
I do not move  
green sometimes engulfs me  
when I see the imbalance of others  
how they shift! and tumble and fall!  
oh how exciting it must be!  
to feel the rush of colour, the brief  
moment of clarity, before you are  
set in passionate motion  
I do not know of motion, for I am flat  
and grey, and even this green  
passes away.
