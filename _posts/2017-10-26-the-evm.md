A column of buttons; strange  
pictograms, out of a book of parables;  
a lotus here, a hand there; even a broom  
names unknown; attached to these  
pictures.  

The gentle motion of my finger in a downward fashion  
is important, they tell me; it will  
reduce pollution; it will  
stop starvation; it will  
end corruption; it will  
change the nation.  
Will it?  

The weight of a billion souls rests  
on this one button press.  
The ups and downs of my prosperity,  
and that of my neighbour's, and of  
the vegetable-vendor, down the street  
who always ignores the few extra grams  
I pile on to save a buck;  
They all rest on this one decision  

I cannot take it, I know far too less;  
I am not qualified, I must confess  
What good my shot in the dark, if  
the bullet hits my country in the head?
