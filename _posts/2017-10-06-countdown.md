Ten  
tiny toes, trembling towards  
the tall table  

*"Nine!"*  
nags nan; need  
nurturing naps  

Eight  
evil enemies  
everyday escapes expected  

Seven  
sucky semesters, somehow  
scrounge stable shift  

Six  
super server souvenirs  
savings still so-so  

Five  
fair fingers; fight  
for first forever  

Four  
fake fiends; foolish  
faith fucks fate  

Three  
tall tumblers; turn  
to tequila this time  

Two  
train tracks; thundering  
towards the terminal  

One  
offering; of odious offal; of  
onerous obligation
