I need to start gymming again  
I've said it a million times  
I've written it down, spoken it aloud  
Even written a poem that rhymes  

Yet the distance between me and that room  
Seems longer than between the earth and the sun  
I do not want to drive all the way there  
Nor jog, swim, walk, hop or run  

I know very well the benefits  
Of a good, sweaty exercise  
I notice with increasing apprehension  
The increase in size of my thighs  

I know I need to go there  
I know I need to move  
I know all of this and yet  
My laziness just seems to improve  

I need a dose of fire  
I need someone to light a spark  
A tiny dollop of desire  
Before my arteries go dark
