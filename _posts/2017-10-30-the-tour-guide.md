Surrounded by bright eyes  
and open minds  
and the spirit of adventure  
the guide sets forth  
to forge a path for their conquest  
and expand their world  
bringing it closer  

Feasting on their curiosity  
the guide weaves a tale  
of ancient mystery, of soothsayers  
and philosophers; the place becomes  
no longer a name on a pamphlet but  
a person to be fondly remembered  

Once dusty streets, with their brown  
sidewalks, and tired people, heat  
threatening to kill fervor, yet the guide  
points to a mundane misshapen rock  
and narrates the battles it has been in  
and the people it has fought, and  
the lives lost because of its actions;  
cool words refresh the face of  
the fellow travellers  
and vigour is restored  

The guide delights in that  
sense of wonder, of  
inviting guests, and foreign minds,  
to partake in his childhood, in  
the place called home; enriching  
their lives, in their brief time here  
with the riches of his country.
