Infinite possibilities; worlds  
and ideas, from  
the next-door neighbour  
infinity made still larger, for the erudite  
mating of thoughts making  
new thoughts  
and adding to that already  
groaning shelf  

The thrill of adventure  
seizes me oddly, even as I  
sit on a cottonspun blanket, amidst  
tales of loss, bravery and sacrifice  
The hero's adventure, echoing endlessly  
in the paper-thin bards  

No imaginative fantasies, I proclaim  
I want substance, knowledge, truth  
a well-researched tome, to move and  
persuade me, and inform and guide me  
Expansion of mind, not mindless expanses  
of meandering ink on white paper  

I reach my hand into the smell  
of old page, and old wisdom, simmering  
in the musty bookshelf, aching  
to be released.
