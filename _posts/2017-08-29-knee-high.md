Moist earth, wet hair, green leaves  
Pitter-patter raindrop, the cool breeze  
White paper boats in brown puddles  
Piping hot milk and mom's warm cuddles

Drenched in the rain today, down with the flu  
Heavy rain today, no school for you  
Heavy rain today, all the lights are out  
And in the darkness, we scream and shout  

*"It's a flood!"* the voices on the idiot box scream  
The whole city acquires moisture's gleam  
The water piles up five feet high  
Drowning the infant's tears as he starts to cry  

O monsoon! What happened? Where have you gone?  
You were such a nice season when you were born  
Now you cause only despair and glum  
O monsoon! What have you become?
