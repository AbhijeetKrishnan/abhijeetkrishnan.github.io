title: The Shallow End

Treading lightly  
into the deep pool,  
I swim in the shallow end,  
Though expected to swim in the other.  

Never liked that place -
too deep, no footing, no  
sense of the bottom.  
Oh some, nay, many -
they like that floaty freedom;  
the bobbing of the body, into  
the blue water, turning everything  
blurry and cold, if only for  
a brief moment.  

I prefer the solid ground  
where I can plant my feet  
and play with the water, creating  
little waves, and splashes, the droplets  
streaming high into the twinkling sun,  
before falling on my face; a child's rain.  

Yet the expectations remain,  
earning me a scornful glance  
every time my long feet  
step into  
the shallow end.
