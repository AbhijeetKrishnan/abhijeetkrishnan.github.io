Quivering about, the bundle darts  
this way and that, pressing against  
the quaint membrane enclosing it,  
entrapping its energy, yet not enough  
to pierce the skin, to break free  

It prods and examines, for flaws and relaxations,  
for a weakness within is a strength without,  
the truest aspect of existence, the abstract given form  
a material nail hammered into  
the wooden post of potential  

There's not enough heat, nor guiding light nor inner sound  
the bundle's fading inside, crowded out  
by the billion other bundles, some which eat the others,  
some provide sustenance, some consume it,  
but all make the membrane stretch, taut and firmer,  
more impervious to machinations, both good and bad  

The bundle searches, for currents of frenzy,  
whose riptides might tear through the oppressor  
slashing away the flesh and weight of emptiness  
it finds one, and rides it gleefully, its journey  
soon will be over  

Rushed across the morass of broken bundles,  
broken by rot of existence in this everchanging plane,  
our bundle escapes, fading outline shining bright  
streaking headlong into the looming wall  
where lights go out  

It splatters headlong against the darkness,  
guts of starlight spread along the bricks,  
casting a brief shine on places long untouched  
by any kind of activity  

The streaks start to fade, the gleam drips down  
fading into cracks along the oblivion cage,  
the inner world continues, unmoving and unperturbed  
yet a single drop of silver escapes, squeezed between  
the shocking stillness, it is enough  
the broken machine springs to life.
