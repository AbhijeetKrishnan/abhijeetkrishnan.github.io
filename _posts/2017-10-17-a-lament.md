Eager hands waved a friend goodbye  
The friend spared not his attention  
I looked away; there emerged a sigh  
At man's technological obsession  
A flower bloomed bright, among  
the cold, hard concrete; a wonder  
for all to see. Yet the crooked sung  
of likes and shares - social blunder  
Tepid drop fell from white hot cup  
Onto the neon screen. A single  
finger cleared the mess up  
Resuming the solitary mingle  
Identity is lost, names are no more  
Why have zombie clicks become a score?
