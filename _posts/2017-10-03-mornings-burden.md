The violent ring  
Of the wretched device  
Burns through my ears  

My eyes creak open  
Yet not fully, for the hinges  
Are gummed with dust  
Mixed with the tears of yesterday  

My eyelids weigh down  
With Atlas' burden  
Perhaps even greater, for he lacked  
This perpetual Siren's call  
Enchanting me to deathly sleep  

A thousand thoughts  
Flit through my mind  
Like so many sparks  
From the fires of fear  
Half-remembered dreams  
Fully remembered worries  

My blanket threatens to encase me  
In its warm and cotton embrace  
I fear the night shall never end  
If I give in to its force  
I pull the blanket off  

The morning air engulfs me  
I breathe it in, let it chill my fever  
The golden rays streaming through the window  
Feed more than just the plants  

I wipe my mind clean of sorrow  
And welcome the new day  
And so, wake up
