It's Friday, there's  
Not much left to do in  
the office. Everyone's  
taking it easy in anticipation of  

Saturday. The gang heads out  
for some trekking through the woods  
surrounding our sleepy town. We  
fill our lungs with the air of freedom  
and exhale monotony.  

We hit the clubs in the night, we  
drink more than we ever do and  
discard our societal skins. The  
parties in the music videos of the  
pop songs in the club come to life  
in the night. We go to bed buzzed as  
fuck, and wake up on  

Sunday, with a bad hangover and  
an embarrassing photo gallery, and  
I don't want to do anything other than  
curl up in my soft sofa with my favourite  
book and sip a hot mug of coffee and  
listen to my favourite jazz on loop. My  
boyfriend calls me to the beach in the  
evening for a long walk and I put my  
hand in his as we talk endlessly about  
nothing and everything and watch the  
sunset on our perfect weekend.
