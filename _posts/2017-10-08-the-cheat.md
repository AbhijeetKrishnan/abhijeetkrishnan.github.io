A long hard grind, a well-worn day  
I came home early to surprise my bae  
In my hand was his favourite whiskey  
But he was in bed with a girl, getting frisky  

Ice on my nipples never felt so frigid  
As the image pouring down my throat  
Never had an orgasm blanked me out  
As the acrid sight of his thing in her mouth  

They caught me staring expressionless  
At their forbidden ecstasy  
Ah, my boyfriend, that wretch,  
Still thought he could placate me  

I placed that wheatish liquid  
On our bedside table  
And left his room, his house, his life  
As soon as I was stable
