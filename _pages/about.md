My name is Abhijeet Krishnan. I am currently a PhD student at NC State University under the advisement of [Dr. Chris Martens](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/cmartens). My primary research interests are in investigating how reinforcement learning policies could be used to improve human skill at a task. My work is an interdisciplinary blend of machine learning and player modeling.

I like competitive coding. I compete fairly regularly on sites like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/MystikNinja), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/rashomon), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/MystikNinja) and [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@rashomon), among others.

I like playing chess. Find me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/mystikninja) and [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/MystikNinja).

I'm interested in graphic design. I first taught myself some Photoshop to help design my UG institute magazines, and I've loved the expressivity that comes with it ever since. Check out the past editions of the magazine [here](https://issuu.com/vnit.mag.com). The issues from 2015-17 contain examples of my work and direction.

I like writing. I've written for my undergraduate institute magazine as well as an informal student blog called [Eyes Only](https://magbloc.wordpress.com/). One of my poems has been featured in NC State's literary and arts magazine, [Windhover](https://windhover.ncsu.edu/battle-against-the-night/).
