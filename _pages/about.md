My name is Abhijeet Krishnan. I am currently a PhD student at NC State University under the advisement of [Dr. Chris Martens](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/cmartens). My primary research interests are in investigating how reinforcement learning policies could be used to improve human skill at a task. My work is an interdisciplinary blend of machine learning and player modeling.

I am passionate about competitive coding. I compete fairly regularly on sites like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/MystikNinja), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/rashomon), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/MystikNinja) and [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@rashomon), among others.

I've become serious about improving as a chess player, after having played on the local Mumbai tournament circuit a long time ago. Find me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/mystikninja) and [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/MystikNinja).

I'm interested in graphic design. I first taught myself some Photoshop to help design my UG institute magazines, and I've loved the expressivity that comes with it ever since. Check out the past editions of the magazine [here](https://issuu.com/vnit.mag.com). The issues from 2015-17 contain examples of my work and direction.

I like writing. I've written for my UG institute magazine as well as an informal literary blog called [Eyes Only](https://magbloc.wordpress.com/) related to the institute. One of my poems has been featured in NC State's literary and arts magazine, [Windhover](https://windhover.ncsu.edu/battle-against-the-night/).

I'm a proud [Tekken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken) player. I've played some earlier games but sharpened my skills on [Tekken 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken_7). I'm looking to entire offline tournaments whenever possible.
