My name is Abhijeet Krishnan. I am currently a PhD ~~student~~ candidate at NC State University under the co-advisement
of [Dr. Arnav Jhala](https://facultyclusters.ncsu.edu/people/ahjhala) and [Dr. Chris
Martens](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/cmartens). My primary research interest is in *interpretable strategy
synthesis* - investigating how we might develop human-oriented computational models of competitive game strategies and
learn them automatically via AI. My work is an interdisciplinary blend of machine learning and player modeling.

I like programming. I try to regularly work on side projects and upload them to my
[GitHub](https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan). Some side projects I'm proud of are -
* a set of generators to pull your submissions from competitive coding websites [<i class="fab

* a bot hosted on Heroku that maintains a points leaderboard for an online forum [<i class="fab
fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan/r-tekken-bot)
* a VS Code extension that implements Reddit's spoiler syntax for the in-built Markdown preview [<i class="fab
  fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan/vscode-markdown-reddit-spoiler)
* a Sokoban solvability predictor that uses machine learning to predict whether a given Sokoban level is likely to be
  solvable [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan/sokoban-solvability-predictor)

I like competitive coding. I compete ~~fairly regularly~~ occasionally on sites like
[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/MystikNinja), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/rashomon),
[AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/winn0w) [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/MystikNinja) and
[HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@rashomon), among others.

I like playing chess. I used to play tournaments when younger, and got to meet [Dhanraj
Pillay](https://twitter.com/dhanrajpillay1) upon helping my school lead the overall points standings one year in the
Inter-school Bournvita Chess Tournament. Find me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/mystikninja) and
[Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/MystikNinja).

I like graphic design. Check out the past editions of my UG institute magazine I helped design
[here](https://issuu.com/vnit.mag.com). I believe the issues from 2015-17 are most influenced by my work and direction.

I like writing. I've written for my undergraduate institute magazine as well as an informal student blog called [Eyes
Only](https://magbloc.wordpress.com/). One of my poems has been featured in NC State's literary and arts magazine,
[Windhover](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/windhover/battle-against-the-night/).

I enjoy playing Tekken. I'm a semi-regular [tournament player](https://www.start.gg/user/b7db2adf) in the RDU area under
the handle. I also help out the [RDU Tekken](https://twitter.com/rdutekken) tournament organizers with Twitter posts and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@rdutekken) thumbnails.
