## Fanorona AEC Environment [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan/fanorona-aec)
[<i class="fab fa-python"></i>](https://pypi.org/project/fanorona-aec/)

An implementation of the board game [Fanorona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanorona) as an
environment [PettingZoo](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/PettingZoo) [AEC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13051) 
interface. The project is intended to be a test bed for a research project involving extracting
*interpretable strategies* which can be presented to a human player in order to improve their skill
at Fanorona. It is expected that this work will extend to uncovering similar strategies for any
other task on which an RL-agent is trained.

## Terragen - a procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan/terragen)

A project developed for the final submission of CSC 562: Game Engine Design. It is a Javascript web
application which uses Perlin noise to generate simple 3D heightmaps using WebGL. It adds tree-like
objects to the map (also using Perlin noise) to improve realism.
