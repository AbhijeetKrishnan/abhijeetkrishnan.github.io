## OpenAI Gym environment for Fanorona [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan/gym-fanorona)

An implementation of the board game [Fanorona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanorona) as an
environment for the OpenAI Gym interface. Some simple agents for the environment have also been
coded, such as minimax and Q-learning. The project is intended to be a test bed for a research
project involving extracting *interpretable strategies* which can be presented to a human player in
order to improve their skill at Fanorona. It is expected that this work will extend to uncovering
similar strategies for any other task on which an RL-agent is trained.

## Terragen - a procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan/terragen)

A project developed for the final submission of CSC 562: Game Engine Design. It is a Javascript web
application which uses Perlin noise to generate simple 3D heightmaps using WebGL. It adds tree-like
objects to the map (also using Perlin noise) to improve realism.
