# TODO

- [ ] ~~Build CV scss file~~ (too time-consuming to get the elements perfectly positioned)
- [ ] Divide posts into "professional" and "personal" blogs, and have local folder structure
reflect that
- [ ] Investigate kramdown extensions to use more tags (keyboard, spoiler) in Markdown posts
- [ ] Use markdown syntax to make "tooltips", abbr tags with title so that some text shows up on
hover (could use something other than abbr too; or maybe could use the notice--info type blocks)

## INFO

Run with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
