- [x] Update CV
- [x] Link Resume to site
- [ ] Add sample publications to test format

- [x] Setup tagging system (how to add tags, how to search by tags, clicking on tag)
- [ ] ~~Fix theme build warnings~~ (went away on their own somehow...)
- [ ] ~~Build CV scss file~~ (too time-consuming to get the elements perfectly positioned, linking to html page with custom styling instead)

- [ ] Update About
